6/3/2025

* This current version has most of the core functionality for descriptive
visual graphs of each numeric field.

* The only problem I ran into while trying to automate the histograms is
a divide by zero error. I was trying to trace where and how that happened.

* What I found was that the Los Angeles data doesn't have much recorded
snowfall. (big surprise there)

  > So that means I'll have to do a try & catch statement for divide by zero
    errors, and skip that graph.

(~20 mins later)

* Fixed the bug by putting a try-except clause for a ZeroDivisionError where
the min, max, range, span values are initialized in the first for loop 
(for i ...) of the histograms() function.

  > If there are no values present, there's nothing to report on, 

* NOTE: Some of the data has outliers on the "10%" and "100%" extremes, 
aka, I need to adjust the scope of values considered for the histograms
to account for non-outlier values. Easy-ish fix. 

  > an idea I have is to initialize a variable which loads the current series
    and eliminates the "5-10% outlier values" to get a better read on the 
    "representative" distribution of data/variation.
